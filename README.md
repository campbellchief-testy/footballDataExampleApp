# Football Data Example App

A retro-style football management app with static data, inspired by classic football management games.

## Screens

1. **Team Screen** (`/`) - Lothian Rangers overview with team summary, next opponents, and action menu
2. **Players Screen** (`/players`) - Player details for S Watson with FIRST TEAM and SUBS roster

Click "Players" in the menu to navigate to the players screen.

## Getting Started

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) in your browser.

## Future Integration

This app will eventually connect to the `footballDataServerApi` project at `http://localhost:3000` for live data.
